# Air University Chatbot
This is mainly a side project just to get to know how to setup a bot in while using local knowledge base. It leverages following 
## 1) Streamlit
Streamalit is a lightweight Python library that simplifies working with streaming data. It provides easy-to-use functions for real-time data processing, handling streams efficiently with minimal memory consumption.
## 2) Hugging Face
Hugging Face is a leading NLP (Natural Language Processing) platform that provides a wide range of powerful tools and pre-trained models for various NLP tasks.I used it for its embedding model.
## 3) LangChain
LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models. As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.
## 4) OpenAI
OpenAI for natural language understanding
